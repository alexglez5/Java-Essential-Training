Encapsulation:
- Packaging complex functionality for ease of programming 
- Access to individual functions can be restricted 
- Hide complex functionality in methods
- The true nature of encapsulated data may also be hidden 

Benefits:
- Breaking functionality into small, maintainable units
- Grouping functions and data together
- Supporting testing of software at a granular level

analogy: a soda machine, you just see a big box and you just have 
to press a bottom, but you don't need to see all the details inside it

Non-Encapsulated Code
- Everything inside main
- Thousands lines of code in one place
