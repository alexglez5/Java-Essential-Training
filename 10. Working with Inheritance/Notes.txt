Inheritance in Java
- Relationship between multiple classes 
- Java supports single inheritance
- Each class can extend multiple interfaces

About Inheritance
- Inheritance relationship can be described as 
	- Parent/child
	- Base/derived
	- Superclass/subclass (preferred Java vocabulary)

About Polymorphism
- Addresses an object as either super or subtype
Ex: List object = new ArrayList();
- Writes methods that accepts supertype as arguments
- Passes instances of subtypes
- Increases code flexibility and re-usability   

Super-classes
- Super-classes don't need special code
- If a class isn't final, it can be extended
- All fields and methods are inherited unless marked as private
- Mark fields as private and add public setter/getter methods
- Mark methods as protected or public 

Subclasses Extend Super-classes 
- Use extends keyword in subclasses declaration to create
the inheritance relationship
